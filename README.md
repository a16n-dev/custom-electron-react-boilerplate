# Custom Electron React Boilerplate

## Scripts

**`dev`** - Starts the app in development mode. Any changes made will be reflected in the app immediately. The app is still run through a file origin.

**`pack`** - Builds the react app and places the resulting bundle into `app/dist`

**`build`** - Builds the electron app using electron builder and outputs the result to `dist`. Note this first calls the `pack` script
